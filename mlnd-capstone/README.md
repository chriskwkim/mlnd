# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Capstone Project

Preventing credit card fraud is an essential part of credit card payment processing. Improving fraud detection system will save a lot of money and improve consumers' experience.

In this project, I explored the data set provided by IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition on Kaggle and apply feature engineering to prepare for machine learning algorithms. Using the prepared data, I applied machine learning algorithms to train the fraud detection model and evaluate the model for the meaningful metrics.


## IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection

Researchers from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) want to improve this figure, while also improving the customer experience. On the Kaggle platform IEEE-CIS has opened a competition IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition.


## Dataset

The training and testing datasets for the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection can be downloaded from [Kaggle's IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data).
